## Architecture of This Project

Project is composed of 4 files, each of them has following responsibilities.

 - main.py : Command Line Interface of this application. Format is identical as the example given at the question sheet.
 - checkout.py : Interface which controls the Pricing Strategies. This interface is created inorder to match the format at the given question. Also, price of each product can be settled at the 'pricelist' variable of this interface class.
 - pricingstrategies.py : Pricing Strategy of the shop. Considering that the similar strategies could be applied in future, with the specific parameter given, same strategy can be applied in different product and numbers.
 - test.py : UnitTest for the core functions and testcases for whole application.
 
 
## Pricing Strategy 

 According to the question, 3 main pricing strategies were released :
 
 1. Buy N Pay M (N>M) 
 2. Buy more than N, get product in discounted price 
 3. Buy A, get B for Free 

 As the owner is assumed to be indecisible with the product prices and strategies, I have offered a flexibility of choosing the type of product and number of N,M at the above. Owner of the shop can design the new strategy just by changing the number of the input parameter.

 For example, at the above functions, simply changing the parameter can help designing the new strategies. 
 Each detailed content of parameter is written at the pricingstrategies.py function
